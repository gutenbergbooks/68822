  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>One December day, Curly-Tail, the
dearest little dog in the world, jumped
upon his Rocking Horse and rocked
away, away, away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>He said, “I will go to Santa Claus’
work-shop, perhaps I will find our old
Parrot.”</p>

<p>He rocked away all day, and when
night came he found a little cave in the
woods. He went in and curled up and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>Next day he woke up early and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve lost the right path, without fail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is a joke on Curly-Tail!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He rocked away, away, away, again,
and soon he said, “Some one is coming
down the path, I hear the patter,
patter of little feet.”</p>

<p>Then he set up a shout, for who
should be coming to meet him but the
Fourteen Little Darling Dogs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>They all set up a shout, crying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, the lost is found,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rocking, rocking o’er the ground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail got down from the Rocking
Horse and said, “I am going to
Santa Claus’ work-shop and this
Rocking Horse knows the way, who
will go with me?”</p>

<p>“I will, I will, I will,” cried the Fourteen
Little Darling Dogs in one breath,
so Curly-Tail got on the Rocking
Horse and rocked away, away, away,
and the Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
ran on behind.</p>

<p>“I see a light ahead,” shouted the
first Little Darling Dog. “I see a
light,” shouted the next, and the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>They came to a little wee house in the
woods.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail without waiting for an
invitation rocked right in the open
door, crying, “Hurrah for Mrs. Santa
Claus! Here we are, the whole Curly-Tail
family!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Santa Claus was so surprised
she cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, ha, by my frilled cap,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I surely must be taking a nap!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She tried to count the Little Darling
Dogs, but they danced about her so
fast, she never knew which ones she
counted twice, and which ones she
never counted at all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="illus03" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption"><i>Hurrah for Mrs. Santa Claus</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail begged, “Please let us go
into Santa Claus work-shop!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Santa Claus said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This thing I will tell you true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such an idea will not do.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She said Santa Claus was not at
home, and she never let any one go in
his work-shop.</p>

<p>Then the first Little Darling Dog sat
down on the floor and began to
grumble, and the next Little Darling
Dog began to weep, and the next Little
Darling Dog got a scowly face, and
such a noise you never heard.</p>

<p>Only Curly-Tail kept good natured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>He rocked gently to and fro on his
wonderful Rocking Horse and said,
“You make as much noise as Daddy
Do-Little when he is lonesome.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Santa Claus said, “Who is
Daddy Do-Little?”</p>

<p>Curly-Tail replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He’s the laziest animal in the woods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He always did little if he could.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you could only hear him grumbling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You would think ’twas thunder rumbling.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Santa Claus said, “If the old
fellow had a new coat, perhaps he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
would not be so lazy or grumble so
much. Here is my work basket, and
some cloth, go to work if you please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Santa Claus opened a slide in
the wall and disappeared!</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” cried the Fourteen
Little Darling Dogs.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail cried, “Hurrah! hurrah,
we will make Daddy Do-Little a new
coat out of this cloth.”</p>

<p>My, how busy they were!</p>

<p>One Little Darling Dog got a tape
measure and measured the cloth.</p>

<p>One Little Darling Dog got a pair
of scissors and went, “snip, snip, snip.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>One Little Darling Dog began to
unwind a spool of thread, and the
other Little Darling Dogs sat around
in groups threading needles!</p>

<p>Curly-Tail skipped about giving directions.</p>

<p>Soon they were all sewing on Daddy
Do-Little’s new coat!</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh,” cried the Little
Darling Dogs, as they pricked themselves
on the needles.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cheer up, cheer up, we’re nearly through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll make a coat that just fits you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Fourteen Little Darling
Dogs began to sing a song and their
needles flew faster and faster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>They would interrupt one another
by shouting, “Who has the thimble?
Who has the thread? Where is my
needle?” and still the song sounded
beautifully.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where will we get buttons do you suppose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To finish up this animal’s clothes?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they heard thump, bump,
down the chimney fell six little brass
buttons.</p>

<p>They sewed the brass buttons on the
coat, and soon it was finished.</p>

<p>Then a voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come into the chimney, ’tis large and wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s room for the Curly-Tails side by side.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>They looked toward the chimney.</p>

<p>There, sure enough were little seats,
and little tables. On each table was
a plate with a pie smoking hot.</p>

<p>How they all enjoyed their lunch!</p>

<p>They cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are happy now because,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of mince pie, Mrs. Santa Claus!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Santa Claus opened the panel
in the wall and went back into the
house. She asked to see the coat,
which they had tied up in a neat
bundle.</p>

<p>The first Little Darling Dog began
to untie the string which held the
bundle, and the bundle hopped about
in the strangest way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Then the next Little Darling Dog
said, “Let me untie it,” and the next
one said, “I will untie it in a minute.”</p>

<p>At that very moment there, before
their very noses, the bundle jumped
out of the window and was gone!</p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
thought their work was all lost and
they began to weep and wail, but
Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cheer up, cheer up, for by the by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We had the nicest kind of pie!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, the Fourteen Little Darling
Dogs all dried their eyes and went to
the door.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail jumped on his Rocking
Horse.</p>

</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
rubbed their eyes for they saw fourteen
Rocking Horses standing in a row.</p>

<p>They shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are so happy now because,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have a present from Santa Claus.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I hope each horse is trusty and good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll rock away through the deep green wood.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When they came to Daddy Do-Little’s
house in the woods they all
set up a shout, for there he stood in the
doorway with his new coat on!</p>

<p>He was happy you may be sure, and
they all rocked round him on their
wonderful Rocking Horses.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Little Curly-Tail called out one
morning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A Happy New Year, A Happy New Year,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And January at last is here.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail curled his little tail up
tighter and tighter, as he ran down
stairs three steps at a time, and he set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the table and got breakfast, before
Daddy Do-Little had a chance to
answer him.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail kept humming over and
over, “A Happy New Year, A Happy
New Year.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hush, what is that?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A-rap, a-tap,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">cried out Daddy Do-Little, suddenly.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was a “rap, tap,
tapping,” at the door, but when they
got to the door, no one was there.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hard lines for one of any age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lose a parrot in a cage.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">said Daddy Do-Little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp58" id="illus05" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="caption"><i>No One Was at the Door</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Just then, they heard a “rap, tap,
tapping,” on the window pane.</p>

<p>They ran quickly of course to the
window but could see no one.</p>

<p>They sat down to breakfast and
Daddy Do-Little said, “More sugar,
please.”</p>

<p>A voice spoke up, “More sugar,
please.”</p>

<p>Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It must be the Parrot, I’ll leave the table</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And find him soon as I am able.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He looked about in-doors and out-doors
and still he could see no one.</p>

<p>Now Daddy Do-Little was a famous
old cook, and he felt like cooking that
morning, but he called,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are out of sugar, how do you suppose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I can make ginger-snaps, goodness knows.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At that, Curly-Tail got out his little
red cap and cape and market basket,
and said, “I will go to the grocers and
get the sugar.”</p>

<p>“Get the sugar,” repeated a familiar
voice, and Daddy Do-Little said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Parrot is hiding, ’tis very true</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll find him now, whatever we do.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They searched one hour and sixteen
minutes but could not find the Parrot.</p>

<p>Little Curly-Tail went out of the
house, “click,” went the gate and he
started down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little came to the door
waving his red pocket handkerchief
frantically, and shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A handkerchief for your little nose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You had better carry I suppose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, Curly-Tail did have a
cold, and so he came back good
naturedly, and got the handkerchief
and started again to the grocers after
the sugar.</p>

<p>This time he did not even get as far
as the garden gate when Daddy Do-Little
rapped on the window, crying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It seems to me it’s rather funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To go for sugar without money.”</div>

  <p class="caption">“<i>And He Started Down the Road</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail laughed and came back
with a hop and a skip and a bound.</p>

<p>Will you believe it? It took Daddy
Do-Little three quarters of an hour
to find his rusty-hinged old pocket
book, and when he found it, it only
had twenty-five cents in it.</p>

<p>Then they looked in the old cracker
jar and found sixteen hundred pennies!</p>

<p>“Pennies will do, pennies will do,”
called a merry voice, but they could
see no one.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail started again.</p>

<p>By this time it was snowing and
blowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="illus07" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="caption">“<i>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs Came Trooping Down the Road</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“Click,” went the gate, he thought
he was off in good earnest this time,
but Daddy Do-Little cried again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Will you ask for white, or brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you come into the town?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then a very surprising thing happened.</p>

<p>A great shout was heard and the
Fourteen Little Darling Dogs came
trooping down the road.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little was thoroughly
and entirely cross at this unlooked for
interruption, and he shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be it fairy tale or fable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To entertain them I’m not able.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail danced up to him and
whispered, “Snowmen, let the Darling
Dogs stay outside and make Snowmen.”</p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
came on with a whoop and a bound,
and Daddy Do-Little shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Make some Snowmen on the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make some Snowmen jolly and round.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
went to work with a will, and Curly-Tail
started off saying, “I will really,
truly get the sugar this time.”</p>

<p>Just as he was nearly out of sight of
the house, he heard a great shout, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the Fourteen Little Darling Dogs ran
after him and brought him back.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There are several kinds of sugar ’tis true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">White, and brown, and red, and blue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It took them all forty-seven minutes
to decide what kind of sugar they
wanted for their ginger snaps, and
what kind of sugar to have on the
frosting.</p>

<p>All this time, the Fourteen Little
Darling Dogs jumped up and down
and said, “Oh Daddy Do-Little are
you really going to make nice, moist
ginger snaps? And can we all stay to
lunch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp56" id="illus08" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="caption"><i>Daddy Do-Little Made Nice Moist Ginger Snaps</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>By and by Curly-Tail slipped off,
and this time he went on safely to the
grocery store.</p>

<p>He got brown sugar to put in the
ginger snaps and red sugar to put on
for frosting.</p>

<p>He went back home with a hop, and
a skip, and a bound, and helped the
Fourteen Little Darling Dogs make
Snowmen, while Daddy Do-Little
made the nice, moist ginger snaps.</p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
were so cold they begged to come in
and warm their paws, so by and by
they all shook off the snow and crept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
quietly into the parlor and sat down
in a semi-circle about the parlor stove,
and warmed their paws.</p>

<p>“A-kit-chew,” sneezed the First
Little Darling Dog.</p>

<p>“A-kit-chew,” sneezed the second.</p>

<p>Just as Daddy Do-Little came to
the door to scold, the Parrot came out
from his hiding place under the sofa
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It really puts me in a rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To spend my life inside this cage.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
crowded around and said, “It must be
a magic cage, see it move.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail said, “Where did you
come from, Sir. I have looked for you
over hill and dale.”</p>

<p>“Poor old Polly,” said Daddy Do-Little.</p>

<p>This put the Parrot in a rage at
once and he shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is, Sir, the greatest folly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give a man, the name of Polly!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
took out their fourteen little pocket
handkerchiefs and laughed until they
cried, waving their handkerchiefs in
the air.</p>

<p>The sun had come out so bright and
warm the Snowmen began to melt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>The Parrot cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you’d take out a bucket of water or so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It might freeze them up again you know.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
got fourteen little pails of water, and
carried out water to pour on their
Snowmen.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail let the parrot out of his
cage, and Daddy Do-Little finished
his moist ginger snaps.</p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
went happily homeward each with a
moist ginger snap, with red sugar
upon it.</p>

<p>Late at night the Parrot called,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To tell my name I am afraid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just listen to that serenade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Snowmen were singing in the
moonlight,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Happy New Year you hear us call,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And little PEDRO is his name.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah,” cried
Curly-Tail, “at last we know the Parrot’s
name,” they looked about, but
the Parrot was nowhere to be seen!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>One day Daddy Do-Little called out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Somebody is late, it makes me pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To receive no answer from Curly-Tail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was no answer sure enough.</p>

<p>The old clock struck twelve, and one,
and still Curly-Tail did not come
home.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little got out his new
yellow and green walking stick, and
started out to look for Curly-Tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Early that morning Curly-Tail had
gone with a hop, and a skip, and a
bound into Farmer Brown’s garden
to get an apple to roast for dinner.</p>

<p>“Click,” went a spring, and for the
first time in his life Curly-Tail was
caught in a trap!</p>

<p>He said, “If I could only uncurl my
tail, if I could only uncurl my tail I
would feel happier.”</p>

<p>His tail was caught in the trap.</p>

<p>He was wondering what he would do
when he heard the “patter, patter,
patter,” of many little feet.</p>

<p>Then a most delightful thing
happened!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
were coming into Farmer Brown’s
garden to get ripe, red, rosy apples to
roast for dinner.</p>

<p>They came with a hop, and a skip
and a bound, and suddenly stopped,
for they saw poor Curly-Tail caught
in the trap.</p>

<p>It took them one hour and fourteen
minutes to find out how to open the
trap, but at last the spring gave with a
“click, click, click” and Curly-Tail was
free once more.</p>

<p>They all were so glad to set Curly-Tail
free that they danced round and
round in a circle, and they all forgot to
get the ripe, red, rosy apples for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp58" id="illus10" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="caption"><i>They Danced Round and Round in a Circle</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
invited Curly-Tail to come to their
home for dinner, which he gladly did.</p>

<p>They all sat down at the table and
the Darling Dogs made a great noise
eating their food.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail said, “If you will come to
my little tent in the woods for supper,
I will teach you some table manners.”</p>

<p>Then he curled his funny little tail
up tighter and tighter, and ran away
to his own little tent in the woods.</p>

<p>At exactly six o’clock the Fourteen
Little Darling Dogs appeared at his
tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>They cried, “Oh,” and “Ah” and
“How very surprising.”</p>

<p>There was a table in the tent with
fifteen little chairs around it.</p>

<p>On the table were plates, and knives,
and forks, and spoons.</p>

<p>There was a cup and saucer for each
one.</p>

<p>They all sat down at the table and
began to talk at once, and drum with
their silver spoons.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is not polite to make a noise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You act like careless girls and boys.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He gave each one of them a little
red and white checked napkin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>By this time they were so hungry and
the food looked so good that they
began to smack their lips.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Eat with a spoon now if you please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, be polite and do not tease.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
took their fourteen little spoons and
began to eat their broth.</p>

<p>It was much too hot and burned
their mouths and they began to weep
and wail.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail gave each one a sip of
milk to cool their mouths, and at this
very minute, some one rapped on a
tree outside saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beside this little tent I’ll stay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas, alack, I’ve lost my way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Daddy Do-Little,” shouted the
Fourteen Little Darling Dogs.</p>

<p>They ran outside and hugged the
old fellow and Curly-Tail was pleased
to invite him into the tent.</p>

<p>The Darling Dogs forgot all about
their table manners for Daddy Do-Little
carried a great basket of good
things to eat, and they danced about
the basket and helped themselves.</p>

<p>By and by Daddy Do-Little grew
tired of the noise and he whispered
something into Curly-Tail’s left ear
and they went outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little spread out his
magic red cotton handkerchief, they
stepped upon it and sailed away, away,
away.</p>

<p>Over hill and dale they went and
sailed right into Daddy Do-Little’s
front yard and landed on his door
step.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail went into the kitchen and
put on a blue and white checked apron,
and made a good fire.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little sat still saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I made some doughnuts goodness knows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some animal stole them, I suppose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail was all this time measuring
and sifting and mixing. By and
by he got out a rolling pin and rolled
out some wonderful cookies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="illus11" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="caption">“<i>Over the Hill and Dale They Went</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>He took the cookie cutter and cut
out cookies shaped like animals.</p>

<p>Soon he had a plate full of cookies
to take to Daddy Do-Little.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little was delighted, he
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little Curly-Tail, by my eyes,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail noticed that one cookie
was larger than the rest and stuck
to the pan.</p>

<p>It grew larger, and larger and larger,
crack, crack it jumped suddenly out of
the pan and came and stood in the
doorway, shouting,</p>

low bow and bounded out of the
window.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little laughed until he
cried.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail ran down the road after
the cookie animal.</p>

<p>The cookie animal shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am ahead in the race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Don’t bite the nose from my face.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail came nearer, and nearer,
and the cookie animal cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t bite my paws, don’t bite my ears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can’t you see I’ve shed some tears?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail came so near that the
cookie animal felt his hot breath and
he whispered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have some feelings, I’m growing pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Don’t come any nearer Curly-Tail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the cookie dog jumped into a
hole in a hollow tree, and though
Curly-Tail stood and coaxed for an
hour he would not come out.</p>

<p>When Curly-Tail got back he found
Daddy Do-Little nodding by the fire.</p>

</div>

<p>Just as he remarked that he thought
they would see the cookie dog no more,
“rap-a-tap,” was heard at the window-pane,
and there stood the cookie dog
singing,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I really wonder how you are,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May I sleep to-night in your cookie jar?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail opened the window and
the cookie dog jumped into the cookie
jar and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little complained,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of a cookie dog I never heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whole thing now seems quite absurd.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They went to bed, and in the morning,
the cookie dog was gone.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>One day Daddy Do-Little went into
the kitchen early scolding,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I may be deaf and rather old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But still you see that I can scold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He looked into his cookie jar and
his doughnut jar, and his cracker jar,
and his ginger snap jar, and he found
though they had been cooking to fill
them up for days and days, they were
all empty!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail tried to get breakfast and
make Daddy Do-Little forget his
troubles, but the old fellow would only
sit in his high backed chair and scold.</p>

<p>By and by Curly-Tail said, “I have
no doubt but Sly Foot, the old Wolf,
knows where your cookies and crackers,
and doughnuts, and ginger snaps
are, and I will go and visit him to-day.”</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’re a cunning fellow and ought to thrive,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But you’ll never come back from there alive.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail laughed as he put on his
new coat and cap and mittens, but
Daddy Do-Little said, “He will make
mince meat of you in a minute.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Though it was spring time, there
had been a light fall of snow, and so
Curly-Tail went down hill on his sled.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little was so sorry to see
him go that he cried real tears into his
new pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail rode away, away, away,
until he came to Sly Foot’s den, then
he stopped, for Sly Foot was within
and roared.</p>

<p>Old Sly Foot said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Growling and thunder, who is there?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it a doggie? Is it a bear?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail replied in a terrible voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Growling and thunder I’m hearty and hale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my name, if you please, Sir, is Curly-Tail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Sly Foot was so surprised to see
his visitor when he came out of the
den that he had not a word to say, so
Curly-Tail continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Your doughnut jar I’ve come to borrow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Either to-day, or else to-morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Sly Foot was so upset at the
mention of the stolen doughnut jar
that he turned a backward somersault
in the snow crying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, the jar will stay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With me to-morrow and yesterday.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Better take back what you have said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But first come riding on my sled.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Sly Foot was so surprised that
Curly-Tail was not afraid of him, he
sat down on the sled with pleasure and
the first thing, the sled turned them
head over heels in a snow drift.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail laughed and said, “Will
you give up the doughnut jar, and the
cookie jar, and the ginger snap jar, and
the cracker jar?”</p>

<p>“Growling and thunder, I’ll not give
them up for that one little bump,”
said Old Sly Foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>The Sled Turned Them Head Over Heels in a Snow Drift</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>So, they dragged the sled up hill
together, when the most surprising
things began to happen!</p>

<p>The sled stood up on end, and began
to chase Sly Foot down hill, it beat
him too, at every step of the way.</p>

<p>“Help, help,” he cried, “will this
sled never stop beating me?”</p>

<p>The sled chased him back into his
den and he stood there growling,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m black and blue, ’tis very true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here are the empty jars for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail saw it was no use to mince
matters, so he went into the woods to
think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>He dressed up as a peddler and went
back to Old Sly Foot’s den and began
to sell his wares.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sly Foot said, “Those
don’t look like a peddler’s feet, those
don’t look like a peddler’s hands.”</p>

<p>Then his voice rose to a shriek and
he said, “Those don’t look like a peddler’s
ears,” and he pulled off Curly-Tail’s
cap and saw he had been fooled.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail only wanted to get into
the den to see where Old Sly Foot had
hidden the cookies, and doughnuts,
and crackers, and ginger snaps.</p>

<p>Old Sly Foot bound Curly-Tail to a
chair and set a kettle over the fire to
boil, saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will boil you very truly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For you seem to me unruly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail blew a little silver whistle
and in trooped the Fourteen Little
Darling Dogs, to his rescue.</p>

<p>As they could not find anything Sly
Foot had taken, they all hastened away
to the grocers, rattling their pennies
in their pockets.</p>

<p>Soon they bought doughnuts, and
cookies, and crackers, and ginger snaps
to fill up Daddy Do-Little’s jars.</p>

<p>As they came to his house they heard
the old fellow saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There’s something to worry me without fail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I wonder what happened to Curly-Tail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

  <p class="caption"><i>Sly Foot Bound Curly-Tail to a Chair</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>When he saw Curly-Tail and the
Fourteen Little Darling Dogs with
their little bags of cookies and doughnuts,
and ginger snaps, and crackers,
he was so pleased, he forgot he was old
and cross and ran out smiling to meet
them.</p>

<p>They went inside and began to eat
out of their paper bags, and Daddy
Do-Little told such funny ghost stories
that the hair rose on their backs a
couple of inches!</p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
were afraid to go home in the dark, so
Daddy Do-Little said.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have made hammocks for fourteen years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’ll be useful too, it now appears.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>He went to a big box and got out
fourteen little hammocks, and strung
them up on hooks for the Fourteen
Little Darling Dogs to occupy.</p>

<p>They were pleased you may be sure.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail went up stairs to occupy
his own little bed.</p>

<p>He cried out, when he woke in the
night,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The doughnut jar’s empty still I suppose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We ate them all up, as every one knows.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, they all ate up the
contents of their little paper bags,
while Daddy Do-Little told ghost
stories.</p>

<p>One bright spring morning Curly-Tail
got up early and crept down stairs
very softly so he would wake no one.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen and packed
a little red and white basket with a
lunch, and soon he was off, and away.</p>

<p>He was going to find Pedro.</p>

<p>He said, “Daddy Do-Little is so
lonesome, I will never come back until
I can find Pedro to keep him
company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>He sang merrily as he went tripping
along through the woods that led to
the town.</p>

<p>It was now nine o’clock.</p>

<p>What should he see but a Circus
Parade.</p>

<p>He came up to the band wagon and
began to spin around after his curly
little tail, and the Band Master said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, don’t be afraid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, join our Circus Day Parade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you mean it?” asked Curly-Tail.</p>

<p>The Band Master replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I talk quite straight, not like a riddle,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Curly-Tail was glad to be helped
up on the band wagon.</p>

<p>He was in a real Circus Day parade.</p>

<p>The Clowns danced and threw colored
candies to the crowd.</p>

<p>The Band played and played.</p>

<p>The horses pranced.</p>

<p>The elephants walked in a long line,
and all was very splendid indeed.</p>

<p>The Band Master said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To do your tricks you must not fail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hope you’re a dancer, Curly-Tail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail was never so proud before
in his life, he danced round and round
after his tight little tail, as he rode on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
top of the Band Wagon, and the crowd
cheered, and said “What a comical
little fellow.”</p>

<p>By and by they came to a big tent
and if you guessed fourteen years you
could never guess who was walking
outside on the tight-rope!</p>

<p>It was his cousin Tangle-Tail, who
was a famous tight-rope walker.</p>

<p>When Tangle-Tail saw Curly-Tail,
he got down off the tight-rope in the
twinkling of an eye and whispered
something to him, then they both
swung up together and walked the
tight-rope together, their funny little
tails curling and twisting tighter, every
step of the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>The crowd cheered, and every one
wanted to go inside the big tent, of
course.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail had a wonderful afternoon.</p>

<p>He rode on the horse’s backs in the
ring, and he walked the tight-rope and
danced on a big drum, but his most
delightful adventure was still to come.</p>

<p>When the Circus was over, he went
near one of the little side-show tents,
and heard some one call out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To be a prisoner is not jolly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And don’t you dare to call me ‘Polly’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail was so excited he did not
know what to do. He ran into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
tent and cried, “Pedro, our dear lost
Pedro.”</p>

<p>Pedro could hardly believe his eyes
when he saw Curly-Tail, but he cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tho’ you know my name’s not Polly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To talk loudly would be folly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They began to talk and plan about
getting Pedro home.</p>

<p>Just then Tangle-Tail came into the
tent, and said they must get a cage,
and there was no time to lose as the
Circus people were coming into the
tent.</p>

<p>Then Tangle-Tail thought of an old
dog-skin he had. He said they would
wrap it around Pedro, and take him
in it down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>They did this, Pedro scolding all
the while.</p>

<p>All would have gone well I am sure,
if they had not met Sly Foot.</p>

<p>He cried, “Ha, ha, ha, I see my
Sunday dinner right here before me.”</p>

<p>Tangle-Tail was never so puzzled before
in his life, and Curly-Tail did not
know what to do either, and all the
time Sly Foot was coming nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>He came so close, they could feel
his hot breath on their cheeks, and he
shouted, “By my whiskers and tail I
will have a fine Sunday dinner!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>At this very minute, Pedro threw
off the dog-skin and flew at Sly Foot,
making a terrible noise, he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sly Foot, if you are not wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll peck out both your big, black eyes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sly Foot cried, “Let me go, Sir, let
me go, Sir, I really meant no harm
whatever, it was just my little joke.”</p>

<p>Then Pedro flew on top of his head,
and shouted in his ear,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You may be a joker, wherever you are,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But don’t you forget the doughnut jar.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Sly Foot howled, “Let me go,
Sir, let me go, Sir.”</p>

<p>Pedro said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Will you leave the Curly-Tails alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And be content with a turkey bone?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Sly Foot promised, and Pedro gave
him a little peck on his head as he
let him go.</p>

<p>By and by when Sly Foot had run
away, Curly-Tail set up a shout, for
the Fourteen Little Darling Dogs were
coming to meet them.</p>

<p>They cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurrah, hurrah, this is very jolly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurrah, hurrah, for our own dear Polly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pedro replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will bite off your ears, you little dears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And peck out the eyes of the next one who cries, ‘POLLY’!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail had once been to school,
and learned a real yell, so he cried,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Who says so?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">WE ALL SAY SO.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">PEDRO.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
said when they got near the house,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Daddy Do-Little is fast asleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us creep in and quiet keep.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pedro flew in the open window.</p>

<p>His cage door was open.</p>

<p>He jumped up on his perch and began
soon to swing to and fro on his
little swing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
sat down in their fourteen little green
rocking chairs, and began to rock to
and fro, to and fro.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail went after his tail and
then Daddy Do-Little woke up saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I had a very pleasant dream,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they all laughed and made
a great noise until Daddy Do-Little
shook his Japanese Parasol, and
pounded on the floor with it to bring
the whole company to order.</p>

<p>Once again they all shouted, “Hurrah,
hurrah!”</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little was not very fond
of work.</p>

<p>He woke up one morning scolding,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I must grumble, oh yes, indeed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I haven’t a single garden seed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This happened at breakfast, and the
Fourteen Little Darling Dogs laid
down their fourteen little spoons, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Curly-Tail and Tangle-Tail called in
one breath, “We will plant your garden,
we will wish for Magic seed.”</p>

<p>Then the funniest thing happened.</p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little turned up his cup,
and there inside, lay a package of garden
seed.</p>

<p>He took up his saucer, there lay
another package of seed.</p>

<p>He looked in his oat-meal bowl,
there lay another package of seeds.</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m surprised indeed to-day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the merry month of May!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>Under everything he picked up was
a package of garden seeds, a present
from his little friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered that he
did not like to work very well, so he
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am too stiff for rake and hoe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I cannot plant seeds in a row.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Fourteen Little Darling
Dogs slipped out of the house and took
up their fourteen little rakes and hoes
and spades, and began to make a garden.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail and Tangle-Tail dropped
in the seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>Daddy Do-Little called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Too many beans and too many peas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plant some cabbage and lettuce please.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Cabbages and lettuce,” shouted
Pedro, “and don’t forget my sunflowers,
how I do like sunflower seeds!”</p>

<p>They worked all day with rake, and
spade, and hoe, and wheelbarrow, and
Daddy Do-Little and Pedro shouted
directions from time to time.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Make a wide path, don’t make it narrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come this way with the old wheelbarrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sun shone warm and bright,
and then patter, patter, patter fell the
rain in a sudden shower.</p>

<p>The Fourteen Little Darling Dogs
took up their fourteen little rakes and
went merrily homeward, shouting,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To make a good garden we always try,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Daddy Do-Little good bye, good bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Daddy Do-Little waved his new
red handkerchief in farewell, and
shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am so lazy, I wonder why,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You always have to call good bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tangle-Tail then made his best bow
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m a tight-rope walker, I make confession</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have to go follow my profession.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As he went off down the road Daddy
Do-Little began to weep, but Curly-Tail
cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m not going away, I promise to stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A year, a week, a month and day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Then Pedro said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If what Parrots say is ever true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll NEVER say good bye to you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Daddy Do-Little felt cheered
up you may be sure. He said to the
Parrot,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’ll have to behave, Sir, for one of your age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’d really expect you to stay in your cage.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turning to Curly-Tail he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis time for bed, oh goodness me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each hour grows later as you see.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They all went merrily to bed.</p>

<p>When the moon came out Curly-Tail
crept down stairs and went out
into the garden, singing little songs
like these,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="illus20" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

  <p class="caption"><i>Curly-Tail Went Out in the Garden</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little seeds you must grow, grow, grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For we have been making a garden you know.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the little seeds sent their roots
down into the earth and they sent
their green shoots up.</p>

<p>They grew very fast, for they were
magic seeds of course.</p>

<p>Curly-Tail danced up to bed and
fell asleep dreaming happy dreams.</p>

<p>In the morning Pedro got breakfast
and Daddy Do-Little was so happy to
have company that he just sat in the
corner and forgot to look out at his
garden all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>When evening came, Curly-Tail
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Daddy Do-Little nobody knows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As well as I, how your garden grows.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They went out together and Daddy
Do-Little rubbed his eyes, for everything
was coming up in even rows.</p>

<p>At that very minute Curly-Tail set
up a shout, for the Fourteen Little
Darling Dogs came trooping along,
and they all had picnic baskets! They
sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A surprise party’s well if it doesn’t fail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A happy birthday to Curly-Tail!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, it was Curly-Tail’s
birthday and the funny part of it was,
nobody knew how old he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>They had the picnic on the porch
and Daddy Do-Little said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am very happy, I’m hale and hearty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I always enjoy a birthday party.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curly-Tail danced so hard round,
and round, and round, after his little
tightly curled up tail, that I think he
danced right out of the book, if you
really want to know what became of
him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Just send him a letter through the mail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And address it to Little Curly-Tail.</div>
  </div>
</div>
